Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
Blessed are the gentle, for they will inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be satisfied.
Blessed are the merciful, for they will receive mercy.
Blessed are the clean in heart, for they will see GOD.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of GOD.
Blessed are those who have been persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are you when they insult you and persecute you and say all kinds of evil against you falsely because of me.
Be glad and rejoice greatly, for your reward is great in heaven. For so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.

Matthew 5:3-12

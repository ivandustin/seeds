Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets.
I came not to destroy, but to fulfill.
For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, one iota or one apostrophe will never pass away from the Law until all have happened.
Therefore, whoever loosens one of the least of these commandments and teaches this way to people will be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does and teaches this, will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
For I tell you that if your righteousness does not exceed more than the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter into the kingdom of heaven.

Matthew 5:17-20

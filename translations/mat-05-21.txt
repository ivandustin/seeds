You heard that it was said to those of old, "Do not kill. And whoever kills is liable to judgment."
But I say to you that all who are angry with his brother are liable to judgment.
And whoever says to his brother "foolish" will be liable to the council.
And whoever says "stupid" will be liable to hell.
Therefore, if you are offering your gift on the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you, leave there your gift in front of the altar and go.
First, be reconciled to your brother, and then come, offer your gift.
